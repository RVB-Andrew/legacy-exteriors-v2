**Retaining walls are a slippery slope’s best friend. Here’s why.**

**Introduction**

Like a dental _retainer_ keeps your teeth held in the **right place**, a retaining wall will **hold** sloped soil behind it. It won’t hold back a _literal_ mountain of dirt, but a properly constructed retaining wall can handle plenty of soil. Unlike a dental retainer, you won’t forget about it – its potential beauty in your lawn will wow you _and_ visitors **every single day**.

Though it’s best used for stabilizing the earth behind it and preventing a landslide on your property, a retaining wall can **easily** become the most gorgeous part of your yard when made with the right stuff. A retaining wall can be made from **concrete blocks**, **timber**, **rocks**, **boulders**, and **poured concrete**, giving you tons of flexibility in its appearance and strength. If the earth’s make is just right, you can even add a garden in the soil, visible from a short or medium height retaining wall. That can turn a stone or brick retaining wall into something truly **special**.

At Legacy Exteriors Inc., we not only **construct** retaining walls, but conduct the **excavation** around them – a single stop for landscaping bliss. **Whether** you live in Windsor, Ontario or Essex County, you can _count_ on the expert staff to assess your needs _correctly_ and deliver a sturdy job every time.

Here are the **benefits**, materials that can be used, and signs of failure that every property or homeowner with a retaining wall **should** read about.

**What are the benefits to having a retaining wall?**

When you consider the benefit to the walls of your _home_ is keeping your family **safe** inside, while keeping thieves, inclement weather, and bugs outside, retaining walls are **no** different. Preventing a hazard in your yard is just as **important**. There are a few key **benefits** to building one in your yard, including their structural support – plus the sheer beauty of a well-constructed retaining wall.

Retaining walls support the earth and soil behind them. These powerful walls **prevent** landslides on your property, working both angles as a lawn feature and a safety measure. Hills and mounds can look incredible in your yard, but if you’re looking for more functional space, look no further than a retaining wall. Our team specializes in excavation and landscaping, making building a retaining wall and reforming the earth around it a cinch.

One little known benefit of retaining walls is the **flood control** they provide. A retaining wall with a properly designed drainage solution is invaluable at **preventing** flooding in your yard. Every benefit we’ve mentioned before, of course, is _contingent_ on the team you choose. The right excavation and landscaping team can bring your yard to perfection, while the **other** can leave you with an unstable, unsafe retaining wall that’ll take your yard down a notch.

**What materials can retaining walls be made of?**

**Climate** can easily affect your retaining wall depending on the material you choose. Windsor and Essex County tend to have stable weather without the biting colds of Northern Ontario or any extreme heat, but **fast** winds, **heavy** downpour, and pests are still an issue. As inexpensive as it can be, a wood retaining wall may have issues with insects, moisture, and wood decomposition over time. Some of this can be avoided with maintenance, but for peace of mind, we often recommend a more **stable** material.

Stones, rocks and boulders are a **solid** idea for your retaining wall. Natural-looking and sturdy, these walls blend in with the **beauty** of the outdoors. The only challenge is maintenance becomes more difficult due to the natural erosion of stone over time. A common choice is using interlocking concrete or recycled material blocks to create a unfaltering tough wall. The face and shape of these blocks can be stamped or designed, so you won’t lose out on a beautiful look.

As you may have picked up on, _any_ retaining wall you build will degrade _over time_ due to wear and nature … but that doesn’t mean you’ll be replacing a retaining wall each decade. Aside from wood retaining walls, you can expect other types of retaining wall to last at least **50 years** – some materials even last up to a **century**!

For more **details** on retaining wall materials, read through this fantastic [article from Allan Block](https://allanblock.com/what-is-a-retaining-wall.aspx#:~:text=A%20retaining%20wall%20is%20a,treated%20timbers%2C%20rocks%20or%20boulders).

**Still… how can I tell if my retaining wall is failing?**

Is your retaining wall **leaning** or bulging forward instead of leaning back towards the uphill slope behind it? Maybe you’re seeing **splits** and **cracks**, soil **erosion**, or deteriorated timber? The Ghostbusters crew put it best: “we believe you”. These are serious issues that you won’t find in _years_ after **working with _us_**, but they’re _inevitable_ decades down the line. No home or yard fixture is permanent on its own. Robust as they may be, retaining walls need to be **maintained** over time to last.

There are a few other factors that can affect the **lifespan** of your wall. We see few natural catastrophes in Windsor and Essex County, so we’re counting weather out. The materials chosen can have an effect, though the right team will _guide_ you to the right material in appearance and **durability**.

Legacy Exteriors Inc.’s construction techniques are _always_ planned out and, thanks to our **expert** knowledge and hands-on know-how, you won’t have to worry about crumbling stone or cracking wood **any time soon**. We also focus on developing **effective** drainage systems to reduce hydrostatic pressure and moisture from dripping through the walls.
