**Moving earth? Choose the right excavation team!**

Starting and finishing a construction and landscaping project starts with choosing a team with that follows through on their promises. If they’re promising unrivaled expertise in something like excavation, they’d _better_ be able to prove it – because depending on the project, it’s often the next big step. You may be wondering if excavation is easy enough to do with a less skilled team. Can’t anyone dig a hole?

The answer is: unless you’re hiding a time capsule, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to finish an excavation project without a reliable team behind the equipment. The masters at Legacy Exteriors Inc. are more than dependable – excavation is our primary focus, and it’s always a project we take pride in completing. Here’s what makes excavation so important, and why you should rely on a contractor you can trust instead of a team armed with shovels and good intentions.

**Excavation is _less_ scary than it sounds. Here’s why.**

Excavation is Legacy Exterior Inc.’s specialty – we have the experience and equipment to provide many services to property owners. Keep in mind what makes excavation so important is that it lays the foundation for every step that follows. Here are the benefits of excavation:

- Excavation allows for enhanced landscaping, letting you design your landscape exactly the way you’d like.
- Improved drainage across your lawn, in the alley between your home and your neighbour’s – you name it!
- As a result of improved drainage, increased longevity of critical parts of your home – from utilities stored beneath the soil to your driveway.
- If there is debris or damage to your lawn, it’s a good way to start over. Dead plants, sunken stones, and irredeemable soil? Not on our watch.
- We also replace driveways to wipe out nasty potholes … and worse!

**Digging without a cause – the _ultimate_ mistake**

Not every project will require major excavation, but if enhanced landscaping is what you’re looking for, it’s important to work with a clean slate. That doesn’t mean you should work with a _team_ who has a clean slate of experience! Here’s what you risk by choosing the wrong contractor.

- A worker could hit a utility line, knocking out power, water, or gas to your home, with no promise as to when everything will be repaired.
- A lazy team means equally lazy results. Not only will your project end up miles away from perfect, but the excavation process could even pass over to others’ property.
- Potential injuries on the job are much higher with an inexperienced team. Delays and setbacks are also common, breaking the set project timeline.

On the other side of the coin, the right team will ensure your excavation project is done on time and as described. Don’t settle for a disorganized team that ‘wings it’. The best results come from a team that cares.
