**Introduction**

An airplane needs a clear, even runway for take off and landing. Why should it be any different for your car? Another analogy: the soundtrack to a great film fits seamlessly into a movie, almost to the point where you don’t notice it’s there. If it’s a blaring zoo of instruments, you’ll notice. It’s the same when you pull up on a driveway: you’ll notice a bumpy, untidy surface with cracks and dents LONG before you notice a perfect one. That's why driveway repair is so important.

That’s not the same story for your neighbours, who tend to see a disaster … faster. A driveway is one of the first things the cars passing by will notice, too, as will pedestrians. What about shoveling snow and salting ice on those rare chilly winters in Windsor, and how about those passing bicyclists in the spring and summer? All it takes is one slip, slide, or crash to ruin someone’s day…

If you’re looking through your window at a real mess, you may want to do something about it. Choose the team at Legacy Exteriors Inc., serving Windsor and Essex County with pride. We’ll repair your driveway the _right_ way, with several years of shared experience specializing in driveways _and_ other home and landscaping services.

**Why should I have my broken-down driveway repaired, sealcoated, or resurfaced?**

Whether your driveway is simply damaged or in a sorry state of disrepair, you’ll wish it wasn’t – and so will your pocketbook! If you’re looking to sell your home, a driveway in good condition can mean a higher market value. A driveway in tip-top shape will only increase value, while a wreck of a driveway will severely lower it. That’s on top of the visual curb appeal to you _and_ your neighbours!


Of course, looks aren’t everything – there’s also safety to worry about. Small fissures are a serious tripping hazard; an issue that should be quashed if your elderly parents visit or are residents in your home. The damage potholes and cracks can do to your car’s tires and steering alignment is _unbelievable!_ We’ve seen _many_ unsafe driveways in Windsor and Essex County – something we’ve had the pleasure of solving for many customers.

All the above can lead to foundation damage from poorly placed and loose pavers, concrete portions, and asphalt. Water will seep into the substructure and damage your home’s foundation. It’s enough to cause a nasty basement leak – the last thing you want to happen, and maybe the last thing you’d expect from a broken driveway. Who wants nasty **mold** when you could have **gold** – the gold standard for driveway repair and sealing, that is, when you choose _us_.
