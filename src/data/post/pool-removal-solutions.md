# Professional Pool Removal in Windsor: Transform Your Backyard Eyesore

## When Your Pool Becomes a Problem

That backyard pool you once enjoyed has become a constant source of frustration. Instead of providing relaxation and entertainment, it's now:

- Collecting algae, leaves, and unwanted wildlife
- Draining your wallet with maintenance costs
- Creating safety concerns for your family and visitors
- Sitting unused for most of the year
- Taking up valuable space in your yard

If this sounds familiar, it might be time to consider professional pool removal. Legacy Exteriors Inc. specializes in efficient, professional pool excavation throughout Windsor and Essex County.

## The Real Cost of Keeping an Aging Pool

Many Windsor homeowners don't realize just how expensive maintaining an older pool can be:

- **Annual maintenance**: $2,500-$5,000 for chemicals, utilities, and basic upkeep
- **Major repairs**: $3,000-$10,000 for liner replacements, concrete repairs, or equipment upgrades
- **Insurance premiums**: Increased rates due to liability concerns
- **Property taxes**: Potentially higher assessments due to the "improvement"

When you factor in the amount of yard space dedicated to a pool you rarely use, the true cost becomes even more significant.
