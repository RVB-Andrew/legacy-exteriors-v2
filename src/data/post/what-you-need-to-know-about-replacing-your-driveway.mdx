## Introduction

What can be done about a **damaged** driveway? In a children’s storybook, the solution would only be limited by your imagination … but in Windsor and Essex County, there’s usually only **one** option for a driveway that’s _truly_ seen better days.

Whether you have a new crack in your driveway or a few, know that not maintaining your driveway can lead to needing your **entire** driveway removed. For more on why it’s important to repair bumps and cracks before they get **worse**, our [driveway repair article](https://www.legacyexteriorsinc.com/driveway-repair-in-windsor/) should give you a good idea.

What goes through our heads when we hear “my driveway’s a **bit** chipped up… can you guys come and reseal it?” When we approach an initial assessment and a client’s driveway has severe gouges and cracks, there’s only one answer. A heavily pitted or damaged driveway in disrepair… shouldn’t be **repaired**. It should be **replaced**.

## So you’re telling me I have to replace my driveway because of a teensy little … ten-foot crack?

Maintenance and repairs on a **severely** cracked driveway do not solve the underlying problems. It’s a **Band-Aid** use of your time to simply cover up concrete that has structural issues. Pulling into your _own_ driveway could become dangerous. How _could_ a two-ton car not cause the cracks to resurface?

What’s even more tricky? The ground beneath your driveway may need additional work, such as **grading**, **leveling**, and **repair**. Concrete driveways compresses the soil and dirt bed underneath over time, sure, but it doesn’t always do so **evenly**. Weeds and other pests can grow between the cracks, leaving an unsightly mark on your property. Thankfully, you’ll have no regrets once you gaze upon that clean, gorgeous – and most importantly, **flat** – driveway.

Removing gravel and concrete driveways is a seriously **demanding** job. Operating machinery to lift heavy slabs of concrete and breaking it up enough to be removed goes above and beyond a basic DIY project. If you’re not sure where to start, start with us. **Legacy Exteriors Inc. specializes** in driveway design and installation, resurfacing, sealcoating, and general maintenance – as well as necessary demolition and removal.

## What should I know about removing concrete driveways?

So, you’re staring at your dilapidated **old** driveway wondering … what now? Do you call someone, or try to handle it yourself? And what **tools** go into smashing up concrete? Here’s a simple tip: concrete is **much**, much harder to break apart when compressed against the ground – it needs to be lifted at one side **before** breaking it. That’s a key reason why you **shouldn’t** go ahead and start chipping away now – lifting a driveway without the know-how, of course, is rather difficult.

Lifting a driveway requires some **heavy-duty machinery** if the driveway slab is heavy. While a sledgehammer can be useful when dealing with thinner concrete driveways, a jackhammer is often used for breaking down thicker pieces, as is machinery for lifting and moving the heavier slabs.

Deconstructing a concrete driveway is a challenging job that should be left to professionals. The job entails lifting and breaking down massive concrete slabs, as well as **removing** any concrete _and_ natural waste and disposing of it in an environmentally friendly manner. If you’re still hoping to treat it like a DIY project, keep in mind you’ll need to check for any required **permits** to remove concrete and identify where utilities are located underground before you proceed.

## What’s so special about removing gravel driveways?

Removing a gravel driveway **may** sound simpler than concrete, but it comes with its own challenges. There are so many small chunks of gravel that could be missed or misplaced, and the bed beneath an older gravel driveway is likely **uneven**. The earth may even need leveling or grading.  Plus, how do you properly dispose of gravel stones with **minimal** harm to the environment?

In smaller cases, gravel stones are raked, and any condensed, compacted areas are broken up in the process. When dealing with larger driveways, a plow attached to a vehicle is often a faster, smarter choice. It’s key to make sure the plow blades are not set too deep, as not to disturb the soil structure below and cause instability. Once all the gravel has been rounded up, it and other waste are removed and safely disposed of to minimize the impact on the environment.

The **skilled team** of professionals at Legacy Exteriors Inc. _gets_ driveways. We also **_get_** excavation, one of our **signature** services, which allows us to grade, level, and repair the surface beneath your former gravel driveway. That’s **essential** to repairing and preparing a space without a driveway for a replacement. After all, it would be upsetting to have a gravel driveway replaced by concrete, except the grading step was skipped and you’re now pulling up on dips and cracks.
