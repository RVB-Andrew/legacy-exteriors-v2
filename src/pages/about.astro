        <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
          After years of working for my father in the industry and running equipment from the age of 7, I decided to
          embark on a new chapter and founded Legacy Exteriors Inc. in January 2022. Growing up in Windsor-Essex gave me
          a unique understanding of the region's landscape, soil conditions, and seasonal challenges.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
          My experience operating equipment from such a young age has given me a deep appreciation for precision work,
          safety, and craftsmanship. What started as working alongside my father has grown into a passion for
          transforming properties throughout Windsor and Essex County.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-lg font-medium">
          We provide highly skilled equipment operation in a safe, timely manner. We take pride in our work and
          thoroughly enjoy this career path. I enjoy meeting new customers and working with them to assist in their
          visions.
