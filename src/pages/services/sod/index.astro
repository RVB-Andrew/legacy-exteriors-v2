    items={[
      {
        title: 'When is the best time to install sod in Windsor?',
        description:
          "While sod can be installed almost year-round in Windsor, the ideal times are spring (April-June) and fall (September-October). These periods offer moderate temperatures and typically more rainfall, which helps the sod establish quickly. Summer installation is possible but requires more diligent watering due to the heat.",
      },
      {
        title: 'How much does sod installation cost in Windsor?',
        description:
          "Sod installation costs vary depending on several factors including yard size, accessibility, amount of preparation required, and sod type. In the Windsor area, you can typically expect to pay between $2.00-$3.50 per square foot for professional installation, including soil preparation. We provide free, detailed quotes after a site assessment to give you an exact price for your specific project.",
      },
      {
        title: 'How long does it take for newly installed sod to root?',
        description:
          "Under optimal conditions, sod begins rooting within 10-14 days of installation. However, it typically takes 4-6 weeks for the root system to establish enough that the sod cannot be easily lifted. Full establishment, where the root system is deep and robust, takes approximately 3 months. Weather conditions, soil quality, and proper care can all affect this timeline.",
      },
      {
        title: 'How soon can I walk on my new sod?',
        description:
          "We recommend limiting foot traffic on newly installed sod for the first 2-3 weeks. During this critical establishment period, the sod is fragile and can be easily damaged or shifted. After 3 weeks, light traffic is generally fine, but you should wait at least 4-6 weeks before resuming normal use of the lawn.",
      },
      {
        title: 'How often should I water my new sod?',
        description:
          "For the first 2 weeks, water daily (sometimes twice daily during hot weather) to keep the sod consistently moist but not waterlogged. In weeks 3-4, reduce to every other day. By weeks 4-6, transition to 1-2 deep waterings per week. We provide a detailed watering schedule tailored to your specific installation and current weather conditions.",
      },
      {
        title: 'Do you offer guarantees on your sod installation?',
        description:
          "Yes, we stand behind our work with a 30-day establishment guarantee on all professional sod installations, provided our care instructions are followed. This covers sod that fails to root properly under normal conditions. We also offer extended care packages that include follow-up visits and maintenance to ensure long-term success.",
