      <p>
        At Legacy Exteriors, we use only the highest quality Kentucky Bluegrass sod that thrives in Windsor's unique
        climate and soil conditions. Our premium sod is:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-3 mb-3 text-muted">
        <li>Grown by reputable local farms</li>
        <li>Harvested fresh for your installation</li>
        <li>Free from weeds and disease</li>
        <li>Resilient to Windsor's seasonal changes</li>
        <li>Selected for your specific soil type and sun exposure</li>

        Kentucky Bluegrass is the perfect choice for Windsor properties due to its excellent heat tolerance, drought
        resistance once established, and ability to self-repair from minor damage. This premium grass variety creates a
        dense, lush lawn with a beautiful deep green color that will be the envy of your neighborhood.

        The Smart Choice for Windsor Properties
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        When comparing sod to seed for Windsor properties, sod offers significant advantages that make it the preferred
        choice for most homeowners:
      </p>
      <div class="bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
        <h4 class="font-bold mb-2">Cost Comparison</h4>
        <p class="mb-2">While sod has a higher upfront cost, the overall value is often better when you consider:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-muted">
          <li>No need to reseed patchy areas</li>
          <li>Reduced water usage after initial establishment</li>
          <li>Fewer weed treatments required</li>
          <li>Immediate increase in property value</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        For Windsor's clay-heavy soil conditions, sod also provides better initial stability and helps improve soil
        structure more quickly than seeded lawns. Our customers consistently report that the instant transformation and
        reliable results make sod well worth the investment.

    classes={{ container: 'max-w-6xl' }}
    items={[
      {
        title: 'When is the best time to install sod in Windsor?',
        description:
          "Sod can be installed almost year-round in Windsor, but the ideal times are spring (April-June) and fall (September-October). These periods offer moderate temperatures and typically more rainfall, which helps the sod establish quickly. Summer installation is possible but requires more diligent watering due to the heat. We generally avoid winter installations when the ground is frozen, but Windsor's relatively mild winters sometimes allow for late-season installation when weather permits.",
      },
      {
        title: 'How much does sod installation cost in Windsor?',
        description:
          'Sod installation costs depend on several factors including yard size, accessibility, amount of preparation required, and sod type. In the Windsor area, professional installation typically ranges from $2.00-$3.50 per square foot, including soil preparation and materials. Larger properties may qualify for volume pricing. The biggest variable is usually the amount of site preparation needed - properties requiring significant grading, soil amendment, or drainage work will be on the higher end of the spectrum. We provide detailed, transparent quotes after a site assessment.',
      },
      {
        title: 'How long does it take for newly installed sod to root?',
        description:
          "In Windsor's climate, sod begins rooting within 10-14 days of installation under optimal conditions. However, complete establishment where the root system is deep and robust typically takes about 4-6 weeks during the growing season. You can gently lift a corner of the sod after two weeks to check for white roots extending into the soil - this indicates successful establishment is underway. Weather conditions, installation timing, and proper watering all affect this timeline. We provide detailed care instructions to ensure optimal rooting for your specific installation.",
      },
      {
        title: 'How soon can I walk on my new sod?',
        description:
          'We recommend limiting foot traffic on newly installed sod for the first 2-3 weeks. During this critical establishment period, the root system is developing, and excessive traffic can prevent proper soil contact. After approximately 3 weeks, light traffic is generally fine, but you should wait at least 4-6 weeks before resuming normal use of the lawn. The first mowing typically occurs 2-3 weeks after installation, once the sod has firmly rooted and grown to approximately 3-4 inches in height.',
      },
      {
        title: 'How often should I water my new sod?',
        description:
          "For the first two weeks, water daily to keep the sod consistently moist (not soggy). During hot weather, this may require twice-daily watering. In weeks 3-4, reduce to every other day with deeper watering. By weeks 4-6, transition to 1-2 deep waterings per week. The exact schedule depends on Windsor's weather conditions, soil type, and sun exposure. Our team provides a customized watering guide specific to your property and seasonal conditions. We're also available for follow-up questions as your lawn establishes.",
      },
      {
        title: 'Do you offer guarantees on your sod installation?',
        description:
          'Yes, we stand behind our work with a 30-day establishment guarantee on all professional sod installations, provided our care instructions are followed. This covers sod that fails to root properly under normal conditions. The guarantee requires that proper watering protocols are followed and documented. We also offer extended care packages that include follow-up visits and maintenance to ensure long-term success. These packages are particularly popular with first-time sod owners who want additional peace of mind and professional guidance.',
