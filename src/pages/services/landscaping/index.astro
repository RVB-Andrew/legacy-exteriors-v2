    items={[
      {
        title: 'Why is proper landscape grading so important in Windsor?',
        description:
          "Windsor's clay-heavy soils and seasonal freeze-thaw cycles make proper grading essential. Without it, water can pool around foundations, basements can flood, and hardscaping features can shift and crack. Our grading services ensure that water flows away from structures, preventing expensive water damage and extending the life of your landscape features. We account for Windsor's unique soil and climate conditions in all our grading work.",
      },
      {
        title: 'What should I expect during the landscape preparation process?',
        description:
          'Our landscape preparation typically begins with clearing unwanted vegetation and debris. Next comes rough grading to establish the basic contours of your landscape. We then install drainage systems if needed, followed by any hardscape features. Final grading prepares the soil for sod or seeding. Throughout the process, our team works efficiently while minimizing disruption to your property. Most residential projects take 3-7 days depending on scope and complexity.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Do you install plants, trees, and garden beds?',
        description:
          "We focus primarily on the structural and groundwork aspects of landscaping rather than planting. Our expertise is in creating the proper foundation through grading, drainage solutions, and hardscape installation. We prepare your landscape with the proper soil conditions and can install sod, but for extensive planting of trees, shrubs, and garden design, we recommend working with one of our trusted softscape partners after we've completed the foundational work.",
      },
      {
        title: 'How do you address drainage issues in my landscape?',
        description:
          "We approach drainage issues with a comprehensive assessment of your property's water patterns. Solutions may include regrading to create proper slopes away from structures, installing French drains or catch basins in problem areas, creating swales to direct water flow, or installing permeable hardscaping that allows water to penetrate. Our drainage solutions are designed specifically for Windsor's climate and soil conditions to provide long-lasting protection.",
      },
      {
        title: 'What types of hardscaping do you install?',
        description:
          'We specialize in installing patios, walkways, retaining walls, steps, and other structural landscape elements using materials like natural stone, concrete pavers, and block systems. All our hardscape installations include proper excavation, base preparation, and drainage considerations to ensure longevity and prevent shifting or settling. We focus on creating durable, functional spaces that complement your property.',
      },
      {
        title: 'How do you ensure your landscape work withstands Windsors seasonal changes?',
        description:
          "Our landscape installations are designed specifically for Windsor's climate challenges. We install deeper foundations for hardscaping to account for frost penetration, use flexible paver systems that accommodate ground movement, and implement proper drainage to prevent water damage during thaws and heavy rains. Our extensive experience with local conditions allows us to create landscapes that remain stable and attractive through all seasons.",
