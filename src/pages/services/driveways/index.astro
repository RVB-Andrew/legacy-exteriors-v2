        title: 'How long does a new driveway installation take?',
        description:
          "A typical driveway installation takes 3-5 days, depending on size, complexity, and weather conditions. This includes 1-2 days for removal and preparation, 1 day for pouring concrete, and 1-2 days for finishing and curing. However, the concrete will need approximately 7 days before it can handle vehicle traffic.",

        title: 'How much does a new concrete driveway cost in Windsor?',
        description:
          "Concrete driveway costs in Windsor typically range from $10-$15 per square foot, depending on size, design complexity, finish options, and site conditions. For an average single-car driveway (12' x 25'), you might expect to pay between $3,000-$4,500. We provide detailed quotes after a site assessment.",

      {
        title: 'How long will my concrete driveway last?',
        description:
          "With proper installation and maintenance, a concrete driveway in Windsor should last 25-30 years or more. Factors affecting lifespan include installation quality, concrete mix strength, proper drainage, regular sealing, and how well it's maintained. Our reinforced concrete driveways are designed specifically to withstand Windsor's climate.",
