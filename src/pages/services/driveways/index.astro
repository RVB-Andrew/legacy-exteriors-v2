    items={[
      {
        title: 'How long does a driveway installation typically take?',
        description:
          'For an average residential concrete driveway, the complete process takes about 5-7 days: 1-2 days for removal and preparation, 1 day for forming and pouring, and 3-4 days for curing before light use. Gravel driveways can be completed in 2-3 days. Weather conditions may affect this timeline. While you can walk on a new concrete driveway after 24-48 hours, we recommend waiting 7 days before driving on it to allow proper curing and strength development.',
      },
      {
        title: 'What causes concrete driveways to crack, and how do you prevent it?',
        description:
          'Cracking typically results from improper base preparation, inadequate concrete thickness, missing control joints, improper curing, or seasonal freeze-thaw cycles. We prevent these issues with thorough base compaction, appropriate concrete thickness (minimum 4-6 inches for residential driveways), strategic control joint placement, proper reinforcement, premium concrete mixes, appropriate curing techniques, and quality sealing. While some hairline cracks may develop naturally, our techniques minimize significant structural cracking.',
      },
      {
        title: 'What maintenance does a concrete driveway require?',
        description:
          'Concrete driveways require minimal maintenance compared to other materials. We recommend: regular cleaning with a pressure washer or stiff broom to remove debris and prevent staining, resealing every 2-3 years to protect against moisture and salt damage, prompt removal of oil or chemical spills to prevent staining, and filling any small cracks that develop to prevent water infiltration. With these simple steps, your concrete driveway should provide decades of service with minimal upkeep.',
      },
      {
        title: 'How do you ensure proper drainage for driveways?',
        description:
          "Proper drainage is essential for driveway longevity. Our approach includes: accurate slope calculation (typically 1/8 inch per foot minimum) to direct water away from your home, strategic grading of surrounding landscape to prevent water flow onto the driveway, installation of channel drains or catch basins in problem areas, and proper tie-ins to existing drainage systems where available. During our initial assessment, we'll identify potential drainage concerns and incorporate appropriate solutions into your driveway design.",
      },
      {
        title: 'What type of warranty do you offer on new driveways?',
        description:
          'We stand behind our workmanship with a comprehensive 5-year warranty on all new concrete driveway installations. This covers structural issues, significant cracking (beyond normal hairline cracks), and drainage problems resulting from improper installation. For gravel driveways, we provide a 2-year warranty on base stability and drainage. Our warranty reflects our confidence in our quality standards and installation techniques.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Is it better to repair my existing driveway or replace it completely?',
        description:
          "This depends on several factors we'll evaluate during our inspection: the age of your current driveway, the extent and type of damage, underlying issues like poor drainage or base failure, and cost considerations. Generally, if your driveway is over 20 years old with multiple cracks, significant settling, or drainage problems, replacement often provides better long-term value. For newer driveways with isolated issues, repairs may be more economical. We'll provide honest recommendations based on your specific situation.",
