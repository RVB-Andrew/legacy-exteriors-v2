    tagline="FAQs"
    classes={{ container: 'max-w-6xl' }}
    items={[
      {
        title: 'How deep do you typically trench for different utilities?',
        description:
          "Trenching depth varies by utility type and local code requirements. In Windsor-Essex, water lines are typically installed 4-5 feet deep to protect from freezing. Electrical conduits require at least 24 inches of cover, while irrigation lines are usually 12-18 inches deep. Gas and sewer lines have their own specific requirements. We ensure all trenching meets or exceeds local building codes.",
      },
      {
        title: 'Will trenching damage my lawn or landscaping?',
        description:
          "While trenching does disturb the soil in the immediate path, we take steps to minimize impact on your property. We carefully remove and preserve sod where possible, use the appropriate sized equipment for your job, and fully restore the area after completion. This includes proper soil compaction, grading, and either replacing saved sod or providing new seed/sod as needed.",
      },
      {
        title: 'How long does a typical residential trenching project take?',
        description:
          "Most residential trenching projects are completed within 1-3 days, depending on the length of the trench, soil conditions, and complexity. Utility trenching for a new home typically takes 1-2 days, while smaller irrigation or drainage trenching can often be completed in a single day. We provide specific timelines during the quote process based on your project's requirements.",
      },
      {
        title: 'How do you handle rocky soil or clay during trenching?',
        description:
          "Windsor-Essex is known for its heavy clay soils, which we're well-equipped to handle. For clay soil, we use specialized trenching equipment with adequate power and appropriate teeth/chains. For areas with rocks or extremely compacted soil, we may use a combination of mechanical trenching and hand-digging techniques. Rest assured that our experience with local soil conditions ensures efficient work regardless of challenges.",
      },
      {
        title: 'Do I need permits for trenching on my property?',
        description:
          "In most cases, trenching that involves utility installations requires permits from Windsor or Essex County municipalities. This is particularly true for water, sewer, and gas connections. Our team handles the permit application process for you, ensuring all work is properly documented and compliant with local regulations.",
      },
      {
        title: 'Can you trench through difficult areas like driveways or walkways?',
        description:
          "Yes, we have techniques for trenching through or under hardscaped areas. When possible, we use boring equipment to tunnel beneath driveways and walkways without disturbing the surface. When trenching across these areas is necessary, we use precision cutting equipment to create clean lines that can be properly restored after the utility installation is complete.",
