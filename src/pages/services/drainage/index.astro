        title: 'What are the warning signs of drainage problems on my property?',
        description:
          "Common indicators of drainage issues include: standing water that doesn't dissipate within 24 hours after rainfall, water pooling near your foundation, basement dampness or flooding, eroding soil in your yard, water stains on basement walls, mold or mildew growth, and damaged or dying grass in consistently wet areas. If you notice any of these signs on your Windsor property, it's best to address them promptly before they lead to costly structural damage.",
      },
      {
        title: 'What type of drainage solution is best for Windsors clay soil?',
        description:
          "Windsor's heavy clay soil presents unique drainage challenges because it doesn't allow water to percolate easily. For these conditions, we typically recommend a combination approach: French drains with proper filtration fabric to prevent clogging, strategic surface grading, and sometimes subsurface drainage layers using coarse aggregates. In severe cases, we may install sump systems in conjunction with foundation drains. Each property requires a custom solution based on specific conditions and the severity of water issues.",
      },
      {
        title: 'How do you determine if my property needs a French drain?',
        description:
          "We assess several factors to determine if a French drain is appropriate: persistent standing water issues, water flowing toward your foundation, basement water infiltration, soil composition, property slope, and the source of excess water. French drains are particularly effective in Windsor's clay soil when installed with the correct aggregate, drainage pipe, and proper slope. During our free assessment, we'll evaluate these factors and recommend whether a French drain is the right solution for your specific drainage issues.",
      },
      {
        title: 'Whats involved in septic system installation?',
        description:
          'A complete septic system installation includes: site evaluation and soil testing, system design and permitting, excavation of the tank area and drain field, tank placement and connection, installation of the drain field pipes and aggregate, backfilling and initial compaction, and final grading of the surface. In Windsor-Essex, we must also account for the high water table in some areas and clay soil considerations. Most residential installations take 2-5 days depending on system size and site conditions.',
      },
      {
        title: 'How do I know if my septic system needs repair?',
        description:
          "Signs that your septic system needs attention include: slow drains throughout your home, gurgling sounds in the plumbing, sewage backups, unusually lush or green grass over the drain field, standing water or soggy ground near the tank or drain field, strong sewage odors around your property, and septic alarm activation (if your system has one). If you notice any of these warning signs, it's important to have your system professionally inspected right away to prevent more serious failures.",
      },
      {
        title: 'Do you handle drainage permits and approvals in Windsor?',
        description:
          'Yes, we manage all necessary permits and approvals for both drainage and septic work. In Windsor-Essex, significant drainage modifications that alter natural water flow patterns or connect to municipal systems require permits. Septic systems always require permits and must meet specific codes. Our team handles the entire permitting process, including applications, drawings, inspections, and final approvals, ensuring your project complies with all local regulations.',
