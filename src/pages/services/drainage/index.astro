    classes={{ container: 'max-w-6xl' }}
    items={[
      {
        title: 'Why do Windsor properties have so many drainage problems?',
        description:
          "Windsor-Essex properties face unique drainage challenges due to several factors: heavy clay soil that doesn't drain well naturally, relatively flat topography that doesn't promote natural water movement, high water tables in many areas, and significant seasonal rainfall. Additionally, many older Windsor neighborhoods were built without modern drainage considerations. These combined factors make proper drainage solutions essential for protecting property values and preventing water damage.",
      },
      {
        title: 'How do I know if I need drainage work on my Windsor property?',
        description:
          "Common signs of drainage problems in Windsor include: standing water that persists 24+ hours after rainfall, water pooling against your foundation, wet basement walls or floors, mold or mildew odors, eroded soil in your yard, dying grass in consistently wet areas, and ice buildup in winter from poor drainage. If you notice any of these warning signs, it's best to address them promptly before they lead to more serious structural issues.",
      },
      {
        title: "What drainage solutions work best in Windsor's clay soil?",
        description:
          "For Windsor's challenging clay soil, we typically recommend a comprehensive approach combining: French drains with specialized aggregate and filter fabric, strategic surface grading to create proper slopes, catch basins in low areas, foundation waterproofing systems, and in severe cases, sump pump systems. The exact combination depends on your specific property conditions. Our solutions are engineered specifically for Windsor's soil composition and rainfall patterns.",
      },
      {
        title: 'Do you need permits for drainage work in Windsor?',
        description:
          "In Windsor-Essex, permits are typically required for drainage work that: alters the natural flow of water, connects to municipal systems, affects neighboring properties, or involves significant excavation. Our team handles all necessary permit applications and ensures compliance with Windsor's drainage bylaws, which include specific requirements about where water can be discharged. We manage this entire process for you.",
      },
      {
        title: "How long do drainage systems last in Windsor's climate?",
        description:
          "Properly installed drainage systems in Windsor should last 15-25+ years depending on the system type and materials used. Our drainage solutions are built with premium materials and designed specifically for Windsor's freeze-thaw cycles, clay soil, and rainfall patterns. We provide maintenance recommendations to maximize system lifespan, including periodic inspection and cleaning of key components.",
      },
      {
        title: 'What makes your drainage solutions different from other Windsor contractors?',
        description:
          "Unlike general landscapers or contractors who offer drainage as a secondary service, we specialize in water management solutions specifically engineered for Windsor-Essex properties. Our difference includes: comprehensive site assessment using proper diagnostic techniques, custom system design rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, specialized knowledge of Windsor's soil conditions, proper materials selection for our local climate, and installation techniques that account for seasonal changes. We solve drainage problems permanently, not temporarily.",
